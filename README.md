# Item-Response-Theory
Code for item response theory analyses.   

The code in this repository provides analysis of a group of assessment items at Times 1 and 2. The analysis is based 
on item difficulty and persons' ability. The ouput includes statistics and plots, which describe item difficulty 
as well as provides p-values, or information on significance, of each individual item's difficulty statistic.
